### Security
- Implemented secure-by-default design
- Action logging for full transparency
- Confirmation system for irreversible actions

### Future Enhancements
- Integration with actual browser automation tools (Playwright, Puppeteer)
- Real-time job data extraction from DOM
- Advanced filtering options
- Job application tracking
- Automated test suite
- GUI interface option
- Resume parsing and matching
