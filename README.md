# LinkedIn Job Finder Agent

An AI-powered agent that searches for jobs on LinkedIn using computer-control API for safe, local job searching. This agent operates via your logged-in browser profile and respects all safety and compliance guidelines.

## üéØ Features

- **Safe & Compliant**: Operates only in your logged-in browser profile
- **No Credential Harvesting**: Never stores or transmits credentials
- **Human-Like Behavior**: Adds realistic pacing to avoid detection
- **Confirmation Required**: Asks before any irreversible actions (apply, follow, save)
- **Local Results**: All data stays on your computer
- **Deduplication**: Automatically removes duplicate job listings
- **Flexible Filters**: Support for keywords, location, job type, experience level, remote work, and more
- **Transparent**: Complete action logging for full transparency

## üîí Safety & Compliance

This agent follows strict safety guidelines:

1. **User Control**: Operates only in the user's logged-in browser profile
2. **No Credential Harvesting**: Never attempts to access or store credentials
3. **Respectful Scraping**: Uses human-like pacing and respects site usage rules
4. **Confirmation Required**: Always asks before irreversible actions (Apply, Follow, Save)
5. **Immediate Execution**: Completes tasks in the current session, no background operations
6. **Local Storage**: All results stored locally, never transmitted

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.0 or higher
- An active LinkedIn account (you must be logged in)
- Computer-control API integration (placeholder implementations included)

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ConstantBrum/ai-job-finder.git
cd ai-job-finder

# Install dependencies (if any are added later)
npm install
```

## üíª Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Basic search with keywords
node src/index.js --keywords "software engineer" --location "San Francisco, CA"

# Search for remote senior-level jobs
node src/index.js --keywords "developer" --remote "remote" --experience "senior"

# Search with Easy Apply filter
node src/index.js --keywords "data scientist" --easy-apply

# Use a task JSON file
node src/index.js examples/task-basic.json

# Show help
node src/index.js --help
```

### Task JSON Format

Create a JSON file with your search criteria:

```json
{
  "goal": "Find software engineering jobs",
  "filters": {
    "keywords": "software engineer",
    "location": "San Francisco, CA",
    "jobType": "full-time",
    "experienceLevel": "mid",
    "remote": "hybrid",
    "datePosted": "past week",
    "easyApply": false,
    "company": "Google",
    "industry": "technology"
  }
}
```

### Supported Filters

| Filter | Description | Example Values |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `keywords` | Job search keywords | "software engineer", "data scientist" |
| `location` | Job location | "San Francisco, CA", "New York, NY" |
| `jobType` | Employment type | "full-time", "part-time", "contract", "internship" |
| `experienceLevel` | Experience level | "entry", "mid", "senior", "director", "executive" |
| `remote` | Remote work type | "on-site", "remote", "hybrid" |
| `datePosted` | Posting date range | "today", "past week", "past month" |
| `easyApply` | Easy Apply filter | `true` or `false` |
| `company` | Company name | "Google", "Microsoft" |
| `industry` | Industry filter | "technology", "finance" |

## üìÇ Examples

The `examples/` directory contains sample task files:

- `task-basic.json` - Basic job search with common filters
- `task-remote.json` - Remote job search with Easy Apply
- `task-entry-level.json` - Entry-level positions for recent graduates

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project consists of three main components:

### 1. Computer Control API (`src/computer-control-api.js`)

Provides wrapper functions for browser automation:
- `open_url(url)` - Navigate to a URL
- `wait_for(selector, timeout)` - Wait for elements
- `click(selector)` - Click elements
- `type(text, into)` - Type text
- `scroll(amount)` - Scroll the page
- `get_text(selector)` - Extract text
- And more...

### 2. LinkedIn Job Agent (`src/linkedin-job-agent.js`)

Core agent functionality:
- Task parsing and filter handling
- LinkedIn URL construction
- Job extraction and deduplication
- Safety controls and confirmation prompts
- Result export (JSON, CSV)

### 3. Main Entry Point (`src/index.js`)

CLI interface:
- Command-line argument parsing
- Task file loading
- Agent execution
- Result reporting

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### What This Agent Does

- ‚úÖ Searches for jobs using your logged-in LinkedIn session
- ‚úÖ Respects LinkedIn's usage policies with human-like pacing
- ‚úÖ Stores all results locally on your machine
- ‚úÖ Provides complete transparency via action logging
- ‚úÖ Asks for confirmation before any irreversible actions

### What This Agent Does NOT Do

- ‚ùå Never attempts to harvest or store credentials
- ‚ùå Never performs aggressive scraping
- ‚ùå Never runs in the background without user knowledge
- ‚ùå Never transmits data to external services
- ‚ùå Never takes irreversible actions without confirmation

## üîß Integration with Computer-Control API

This implementation includes placeholder functions for the computer-control API. In a production environment, you would need to:

1. Replace the placeholder implementations in `src/computer-control-api.js`
2. Connect to your actual computer-control system (e.g., Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium)
3. Implement the confirmation mechanism (e.g., CLI prompts, GUI dialogs)

Example integration points:

```javascript
// Replace placeholders with actual implementations
async open_url(url) {
  // Your computer-control API call here
  await yourBrowserAPI.navigate(url);
}

async click(selector) {
  // Your computer-control API call here
  await yourBrowserAPI.clickElement(selector);
}
```

## üìä Output Format

Results are returned in the following structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 25,
  "jobs": [
    {
      "id": "job-12345",
      "title": "Senior Software Engineer",
      "company": "Tech Company",
      "location": "San Francisco, CA",
      "description": "Job description...",
      "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/12345",
      "postedDate": "2025-10-20T12:00:00Z",
      "easyApply": true
    }
  ],
  "filters": { /* applied filters */ },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-21T18:43:00Z",
  "actionLog": [ /* all actions taken */ ]
}
```
