# Security Policy

## Overview

The LinkedIn Job Finder Agent is designed with security and privacy as top priorities. This document outlines our security practices, policies, and guidelines.

## üîí Security Principles

### 1. No Credential Harvesting
- **Never** attempts to access, store, or transmit user credentials
- Operates only in the user's logged-in browser session
- No password prompts, no credential storage

### 2. Local Data Storage
- All job search results remain on the user's local machine
- No data transmission to external servers
- No cloud storage or external APIs

### 3. User Consent
- Requires explicit confirmation for irreversible actions
- Transparent action logging
- User has full control over all operations

### 4. Respectful Automation
- Human-like pacing to respect site policies
- No aggressive scraping or rate limit violations
- Reasonable delays between actions

### 5. Transparency
- Complete action logging
- Clear documentation of all operations
- Open source code for audit

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Action Logging
Every action is logged with:
- Timestamp
- Action type
- Parameters used
- Result status

Example log entry:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-21T18:43:00Z",
  "action": "click",
  "details": {
    "selector": ".job-card"
  }
}
```

### Confirmation System
Irreversible actions require confirmation:
- Job applications
- Following companies
- Saving searches
- Sending messages

### Rate Limiting
Built-in delays between actions:
- Typing: 50-150ms per character
- Clicks: 500-1500ms between clicks
- Scrolls: 300-800ms between scrolls
- Page loads: up to 10 seconds

### Input Validation
All user inputs are validated:
- Task JSON structure
- Filter parameters
- File paths
- URLs

## üö® Reporting Security Issues

### Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Do NOT open a public issue**
2. Email the maintainers privately
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What Qualifies as a Security Issue

- Credential harvesting or storage
- Data exfiltration
- Unauthorized actions
- Bypass of confirmation mechanisms
- Privacy violations
- Injection vulnerabilities

### What is NOT a Security Issue

- Feature requests
- Performance issues
- UI/UX improvements
- Documentation errors

## ‚úÖ Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Verify Source**: Only use official releases from trusted sources
2. **Review Code**: This is open source - audit the code before use
3. **Stay Updated**: Keep the tool updated with latest security patches
4. **Monitor Actions**: Review action logs after each run
5. **Use Confirmation**: Never disable the confirmation system
6. **Local Storage**: Ensure results are stored in secure locations

### For Developers

1. **Code Review**: All PRs must be reviewed for security
2. **No Secrets**: Never commit credentials or API keys
3. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
4. **Safe APIs**: Use safe, well-tested libraries
5. **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully without exposing sensitive data
6. **Documentation**: Document security implications of changes

### For Integrators

1. **Custom API**: Secure your computer-control API implementation
2. **Confirmation**: Implement robust confirmation mechanisms
3. **Session Management**: Properly manage browser sessions
4. **Data Handling**: Secure storage and handling of job data
5. **Rate Limiting**: Respect site policies and rate limits
